# CombineTextFiles
This repository contains a PowerShell script that appends the contents of two text files to a new text file. The script can be used to combine multiple text files into a single file.

## Requirements

* PowerShell 5.1 or higher

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it from the command line. The script will prompt you for the names of the two text files that you want to append. The script will then create a new text file called `combined.txt` and append the contents of the two text files to it.

For example, to append the contents of the text files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` to a new text file called `combined.txt`, you would run the following command:


./AppendTextFiles.ps1


## Features

* Appends the contents of two text files to a new text file.
* Easy to use. Simply run the script from the command line.
* Supports any text file format.

## Limitations

* Does not support custom formatting.
* Does not support attachments.
